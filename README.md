# Thunderbolt 3 - Force Power Enabler and ACPI controller service


Backstory: The idea was to make Thunderbolt to work all time while laptop is working.
           Generaly it is great for Hackintosh. But decided to go further and to create 
           a universal thing. So any debug info and comments are welcome.

Universal ACPI driver for Full-Time Enable Thunerbolt Controller.
Also this driver control WAKE from sleep and yet has great stability at Zbook G3 and Zbook G4

For the future builds, it will have more RAM patches and other stuff for better functionality

Read README files at Subfolders for correct usage of ACPI driver
